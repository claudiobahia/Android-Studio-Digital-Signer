# Android-Studio-Digital-Signer
<p><b>I'm developing a Digital Sign application.</b></p>

# Why am I making this?
<p>I'm doing this because I like mobile apps and I want to improve my skills at it. I'm creating
it with a really short time to delevopment, it will be hard but in 3 weeks it will be completed and
functional to my office starts to use it as a real deal. (I did it!)</p>

# What does it do?
<p>BBSigner will store the employee name, our client name and the description of why is the client signing it.</p>
<p>The sign screen will be screenshotted to get current date time from the cellphone, just incase something judicial happens.</p>
<p>The database will be at a .txt file where the line will store all informations and the image dir.</p>
<p>The app will also list client names and inside of it will be the rest of the information.</p>

# How do I install it?
<p>Just cloning the application will solve that problem, the only thing you need to do is to connect it to your own Firebase Realtime Databse.</p>
